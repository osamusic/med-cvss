This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and optimized production builds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` / `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with Vite's fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload instantly when you make edits.
Build errors and warnings are displayed in the browser overlay.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner using Vitest in watch mode.
Tests run automatically when files change for rapid feedback.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Runs tests with coverage reporting.
Generates detailed coverage reports in multiple formats.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production using Vite.
Optimizes the build for best performance with tree-shaking and code splitting.

Output is generated in the `build/` directory.
Files are minified and include content hashes for optimal caching.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally for testing.
Useful for verifying the build before deployment.

### Code Quality Scripts

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run quality` - Run all quality checks (type-check, lint, format, tests)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure
- **IntegratedCVSSCalculator**: Technical CVSS metric selection interface with real-time calculation
- **ThreatAnalysis**: AI-powered threat assessment from Japanese descriptions (MCP)
- **CVSSComparison**: Before/after evaluation with custom scenario management
- **ScenarioEditor**: Modal interface for creating and editing scenarios
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration for secure user sessions

### Data Flow
1. **Manual Assessment**: Questionnaire collects user responses and maps to CVSS metrics
2. **AI Assessment**: Japanese threat descriptions are analyzed via MCP to extract CVSS metrics
3. Navigation state passes selected values to calculator
4. Calculator performs real-time CVSS v3.1/v4.0 calculations
5. Results display score, severity rating, and vector string
6. Custom scenarios are stored locally or in Firebase Firestore

### Key Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR and optimized production builds
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework with watch mode
- **Firebase**: Authentication and Firestore database
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: AI threat analysis integration
- **CVSS v3.1 & v4.0**: Full specification implementation
- **Component-scoped CSS**: Modular styling approach

## üîß Configuration

### Storage Options

**Local Storage** (Default):
```typescript
const scenarioManager = useCustomScenarios('localStorage');
```

**Firebase Cloud Storage**:
```typescript
const scenarioManager = useCustomScenarios('firebase', user?.uid);
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.example` and configure the following variables:

#### Firebase Configuration (Required for authentication and cloud storage)
```bash
# Firebase project settings from Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Optional: Development settings
