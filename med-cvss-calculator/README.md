# Medical Device CVSS Calculator

A React TypeScript application that implements both CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 vulnerability scoring systems for medical device security assessment. The application provides both a guided questionnaire interface for non-technical users and a technical calculator interface for cybersecurity professionals.

## ‚ú® Features

- **CVSS v3.1 & v4.0 Calculator**: Full implementation of both CVSS specifications
- **AI Threat Assessment**: Automated CVSS scoring from Japanese threat descriptions using MCP
- **Before/After Comparison**: Evaluate risk reduction after implementing remediation measures
- **Medical Device Scenarios**: Pre-built scenarios for healthcare environments
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create, edit, and manage your own remediation scenarios
- **Data Persistence**: Choose between localStorage or Firebase cloud storage
- **Export/Import**: Share scenarios between teams and environments
- **User Authentication**: Secure user-specific data with Firebase Auth

## üè• Medical Device Focus

Designed specifically for healthcare environments with:
- Patient data protection scenarios
- Medical device availability considerations
- Healthcare integrity impact assessments
- Device-specific vulnerability examples (infusion pumps, Bluetooth devices, etc.)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Firebase project (optional, for cloud storage and authentication)
- Claude Desktop with MCP support (optional, for AI threat assessment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **For Local Storage Only** (Skip Firebase setup):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **For Full Features (Firebase + MCP)**:
   - Follow the [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your Firebase configuration
   - Set up [med-mcp-threat server](https://github.com/osamusic/med-mcp-threat) in Claude Desktop
   - Start the application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure
- **IntegratedCVSSCalculator**: Technical CVSS metric selection interface with real-time calculation
- **ThreatAnalysis**: AI-powered threat assessment from Japanese descriptions (MCP)
- **CVSSComparison**: Before/after evaluation with custom scenario management
- **ScenarioEditor**: Modal interface for creating and editing scenarios
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth integration for secure user sessions

### Data Flow
1. **Manual Assessment**: Questionnaire collects user responses and maps to CVSS metrics
2. **AI Assessment**: Japanese threat descriptions are analyzed via MCP to extract CVSS metrics
3. Navigation state passes selected values to calculator
4. Calculator performs real-time CVSS v3.1/v4.0 calculations
5. Results display score, severity rating, and vector string
6. Custom scenarios are stored locally or in Firebase Firestore

### Key Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Firebase**: Authentication and Firestore database
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: AI threat analysis integration
- **CVSS v3.1 & v4.0**: Full specification implementation
- **Component-scoped CSS**: Modular styling approach

## üîß Configuration

### Storage Options

**Local Storage** (Default):
```typescript
const scenarioManager = useCustomScenarios('localStorage');
```

**Firebase Cloud Storage**:
```typescript
const scenarioManager = useCustomScenarios('firebase', user?.uid);
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.example` and configure the following variables:

#### Firebase Configuration (Required for authentication and cloud storage)
```bash
# Firebase project settings from Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Optional: Development settings

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DEBUG=false
```

#### Storage Configuration
```bash
# Choose storage backend: 'localStorage' or 'firebase'
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_STORAGE_TYPE=localStorage
```

#### MCP Threat Analysis Configuration
```bash
# Enable MCP threat extraction features
REACT_APP_MCP_ENABLED=true
# MCP server name for threat extraction
